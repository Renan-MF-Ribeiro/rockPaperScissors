## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SCSS custom properties
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Angular](https://angular.io/) - Framework
- [Styled Preprocessors](https://tailwindcss.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

What I learned from this challenge mainly was responsive layout and adjustment based on the breakpoint of mobile, tablet, notebook and desktop screens.

```css
.bg-size {
  background-size: 90%;

  @media screen and (min-width: 500px) {
    background-size: 80%;
  }
}
```

### Continued development

As a focus of continuous development, I intend to increase my knowledge in creating and publishing Angular libraries of specific components that facilitate and speed up application development.
